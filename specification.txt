# A MiR does two things: goto_ur and goto_delivery
# A UR does one thing: place_obj onto a MiR
# There is one MiR component and one UR component



(Variable v1 goto_ur MiR)

(Constraint Duration v3 v3 [4000,INF])

# MiR has to be finished with goto_ur before UR starts palce_obj  
(Constraint Before v1 v3)

# UR has to have finished place_obj before MiR can start goto_delivery
